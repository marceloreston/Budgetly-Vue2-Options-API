# Budgetly (Vue.js v2)

In this **SPA** (single-page-application) I used **HTML**, **CSS**, **Tailwind CSS**, **GSAP**, and **Vue.js** to create an interesting budget calculator with animation effects.
It allows you to easily keep track of your incomes and expenses.

Feel free to take a look at the source code and give it an update, in case you're intereseted.
